# Overview

This is a full-stack web application built as a personal portfolio website with a cyberpunk/futuristic theme. The application features a React frontend with TypeScript, a Node.js/Express backend, and uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence. The frontend includes interactive loading screens, animated transitions, and a dashboard-style interface showcasing skills, projects, and contact information. The application is configured for deployment on Replit with development tooling and hot reloading capabilities.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern component patterns
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system for consistent, accessible components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk theme variables and animations
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for complex animations, transitions, and interactive effects
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework for REST API endpoints
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules for modern JavaScript features
- **Data Layer**: Modular storage interface pattern allowing for different implementations (currently using in-memory storage with MemStorage class)
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints prefixed with `/api` for clear separation from frontend routes
- **Development**: Hot reloading with tsx for TypeScript execution

## Database & ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL configured for production use
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript-first schema definitions
- **Schema**: User entity with username/password fields, extensible for additional features
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations and management
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless driver for cloud PostgreSQL connectivity

## Development Environment
- **Package Manager**: npm with lockfile for dependency consistency
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration with path aliases for clean imports
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server with Express API proxy
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and TypeScript compiler for code validation
- **Replit Integration**: Custom plugins for development banner, error overlay, and cartographer

## Authentication & Security
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store using connect-pg-simple
- **Password Storage**: Prepared for bcrypt hashing (implementation pending)
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests during development
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration for database connections and API keys

## File Structure
- **client/**: React frontend application with components, pages, and assets
- **server/**: Express backend with routes, storage layer, and middleware
- **shared/**: Common TypeScript schemas and types used by both frontend and backend
- **migrations/**: Database migration files generated by Drizzle Kit
